A review of the common Data structures and algorithms

#### Review Outline
- Trees (Binary Search, Red-Black, binary, BST, AVL, 2-3, splay)
- Graphs (un/directed, un/weighted)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Linked Lists (singly linked, doubly linked, circularly linked)
- Stacks
- Queues (inc. Priority)
- Arrays
- Array Lists

#### General Review
The basics of data structures form the foundation of computer science and programming. Here are some fundamental data structures:

##### Arrays:
- An ordered collection of elements where each element can be accessed using an index.
- Operations include insertion, deletion, and access.
- Arrays have constant time access to elements (O(1)), but insertion and deletion may be O(n) in the worst case.

##### Linked Lists:
- A collection of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
- Operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- Linked lists allow for dynamic memory allocation but have slower access times compared to arrays.

##### Stacks:
- A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end (the top).
- Operations include push (add an element) and pop (remove the top element).
- Stacks are used for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms.

##### Queues:
- A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
- Operations include enqueue (add an element) and dequeue (remove the front element).
- Queues are used in scenarios like task scheduling and breadth-first search in graphs.

##### Trees:
- A hierarchical data structure with a root element and subtrees of children with a parent-child relationship.
- Binary Trees: Each node has at most two children (left and right).
- Binary Search Trees (BST): A binary tree with the property that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

##### Graphs:
- A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting these nodes.
- Directed Graphs: Edges have a direction.
- Undirected Graphs: Edges have no direction.
- Graphs can be represented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists.

##### Heaps:
- A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- Max Heap: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
- Min Heap: The value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children.
- Heaps are commonly used for implementing priority queues.

##### Hash Tables:
- A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets.
- Allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data.
- Hash collisions (different keys hashing to the same index) need to be handled.
